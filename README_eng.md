# Lithuanian Keyboard Layout UEYOQJ or "Ratise"

version 2.4

Lithuanian ergonomic computer keyboard layout ŪĖYOQJ or “Ratisė” is designed for convenient touch typing of Lithuanian text with all fingers, the so-called “blind” way. The layout also allows you to conveniently type in English, programming languages, and enter special letters and characters.

Vowels and consonants are distinguished for different hands. The more frequently used letters and signs occupy more comfortable places in the layout, and fall on more powerful fingers. The characters are arranged neatly to make the layout more comfortable and easier to remember.
